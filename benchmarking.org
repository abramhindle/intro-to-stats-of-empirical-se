* Performance Benchmarking
  - Abram Hindle <hindle1@ualberta.ca> <2020-12-02 Wed>
  - Discussing SOFTWARE Benchmarking
** Purpose
   - to know how fast hardware is
   - to know how fast software is
   - to know how a system handles various loads
   - to push a system into a state to observe effects
   - to compare systems based on performance
** Types of Performance Benchmarks
   - Throughput
     - how many operations per time unit
       - floating point ops per second
   - Time-based / Task-based
     - the time or resource consumed to complete a task
   - Mixed
     - a combination
** General Methodology
   - Setup System under test
   - repeat 10+ times or
     - setup test
     - Test & Measure
     - tear down test
     - record result
   - summarize and compare
*** Choices
    - what to measure
    - how to measure
    - how to setup
    - how to teardown
    - what to control for
    - what not to control for
    - realism concerns
** SPEC
   - Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation
   - Maintains and charges money for benchmarks.
   - Because they charge money for benchmarks that include free
     software I would remain skeptical.
   - Academics do man the committees that produce the benchmarks.
** CPU
   - Has CPU state which is the frequency that the CPU runs at.
   - lower frequency is slower and uses less energy, higher latency
   - high frequency is faster and uses more energy.
   - General purpose CPUs do a lot of things at once
*** Integer
    - How does it move data around and do basic math
*** Floating Point
    - how does it deal with floating point numbers
*** Vectorized Performance
    - Batching similar results
    - mapping values
    - can impact performance with compilers and JIT that support or don't support vector ops.
*** CPU States
    - Different frequencies consume different energy
    - Different frequencies on different cores    
*** Power issues
    - If there's not enough power the CPU might not run at appropriate rates and might clock down
    - If there's not enough voltage you can't use lots of different features
*** Heat issues
    - CPUs that get too hot will shutdown or clock down.
    - Heat can be inconsistent
    - Ambient enviroment matters
** SUT
   - System under test
   - what you are measuring
   - usually should be setup to represent the scenario you are testing
   - should be controllable
   - can be a simple piece of software
   - can be a cloud
** Confounds
*** Cache
    - caching at all levels will change performance
    - this is why people like to throw away initial measurements
      because they want the most cached highest performance examples
      - totally unrealistic though
*** Granularity of measurement
    - things on computers are quick
      - will you be able to capture the effect?
    - Did you measure the entire system or part of it
      - measuring part ignores the induced load
      - measuring everything hides effects in noise
*** Contexts
    - Realism
      - a phone in a pocket
      - a laptop in a cafe
      - a server in a datacenter
      - a cloud VM
    - Micro Benchmark
      - Not realistic
      - meant to know the best performance of a SUT
      - commonly used to compare 2 pieces of code
      - https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/which-programs-are-fastest.html
      - Typically 300X improvement in a Micro Benchmark might show up
        as less than 5% performance improvement in the wild where the
        software is not used in the same way or at the same rate.
    - Scenarios
      - maybe an attempt at realism
      - but goal oriented
    - Task based
      - measure effectiveness at a task according to some resource limitations
*** Instrumentation overhead
    - how is the test being run? 
    - how much does it cost to the run the test
    - For UI tests
      - does it need to reflect on objects to know what to click
      - does it need DOM access?
      - is a click the same as a mushy finger click
      - injected touch events are less work that multitouch events from the touch screen
    - If you're watching method calls what is the cost of that?
*** Background Processes
    - If too much is going on measurements will be more variable
*** CPU State   
    - what state did you state the test in
    - is the governor on
    - what is the frequency
    - will it change frequency during the test
*** Temperature
    - What is the temperature of the SUT before and during test?
*** Network
    - If you're using wifi or the internet are the contexts comparable
      - Was amazon down?
      - Was it peak time of day?
    - If you run your tests in a VM or Docker you have overhead
*** Disk
    - Files get cached if you access them often
      - subsequent tests could be faster
    - You change the filesystems
    - repeatability of disk IO is not great
*** Containers
    - low overhead 
    - Copying on IO and Network
    - Good for CPU and memory bound jobs
    - Not clear about GPU
*** VMs
    - high overhead
    - quite controlled
    - repeatable
    - high IO overhead,
    - sometimes very high CPU and memory overhead
    - different virtualization strategies 
*** Cloud
    - usually you don't control the entire cloud
    - performance will differ based on what the cloud is being used for.
** Energy
*** Energy Star
    - https://www.energystar.gov/
    - Estimate energy consumption of appliances, including computers
*** SpecPower
    - Costs money. 3k
    - http://www.spec.org/power_ssj2008/
    - Methodology: http://www.spec.org/power/docs/SPEC-Power_and_Performance_Methodology.pdf
    - High workload benchmark primarily meant for servers.
    - Very server oriented
    - Ignores idle
    - Measures idle only as a baseline
    - Guidelines for power and temperature measure http://www.spec.org/power/docs/SPEC-Power_Measurement_Setup_Guide.pdf
*** ENERGISE
   - The Perils of Energy Mining: Measure a Bunch, Compare just Once
     https://softwareprocess.es/pubs/hindle2016D4SE-energymining.pdf
   - Environment -- prepare a stable testbed for energy measurement.
   - N-versions -- run a test across more than 1 version of the software.
   - Energy or power -- do we care about total energy consumed of a task or the per second
     cost of running a service?
   - Repeat -- 1 run is not enough, we need to run our tests multiple times to address
     background noise.
   - Granularity -- what level of measurement, how often, and what level of invasiveness
     of instrumentation?
   - Idle -- how do applications and service react with no load: is energy being wasted?
   - Statistics -- repeat measures call for summary statistics and comparing distributions.
   - Exceptions -- errors happen, how do we address with them or notice them?
*** GreenUp
   - SpeedUp measures for green software comparison

      - Tutorial https://www.baeldung.com/java-microbenchmark-harness
** Evaluation
   - Evaluation of benchmarking is annoying
   - Reporting is typically done in a relative fashion and that is annoying because we can't see the measurements.
*** Reporting
    - Report the distribution (quartiles)
    - Use box plots! Or violin plots.
    - Provide absolute measurements
      - then provide relative measurements
        - such as speedup
    - Don't report ONLY means. Means aren't meaningful for many time based experiments.
      - Geometric mean is a lot safer
        - "How not to lie with Statistics: The Correct Way to Summarize Benchmark Results", Philip J. Fleming and John J. Wallace
          - http://ece.uprm.edu/~nayda/Courses/Icom5047F06/Papers/paper4.pdf
          - They argue you can't use MEAN on normalized results, you should use geometric mean.
            - They don't discuss median.
            - They do say: "However, it should be made clear that any measure of the mean value of data is misleading when there is
      - Geometric mean is the product of your N measurements taken to the Nth root.
        - e.g., 1,2,3 is (1*2*3)^3 = 1.8
large variance."
    - Provide details of the system including hardware
      - include dates
      - include versions of software
    - Report number of trials
    - COV is often used to compare variance
      - standard deviation / mean
      - it's a normalized variance
    - Some people report on the best results.
      - This baloney and deceptive. Don't do it.
      - There are some scenarios where this would matter but most cases this is dangerous.
    - You can use speedup but it's not very sound and makes assumptions that the mean is meaningful.

        - https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00764454/document/
    - Effect sizes such as Cliff's Delta can be used to show that
      there is a difference and it has an effect.
*** Comparison
    - Use confidence intervals of the difference.
      - You should be comparing 10+ versus 10+ runs so get the 95%
        confidence interval of the difference! You can just boostrap
        it.
    - Use statistical tests to compare distributions
      - T-Test for normally distribution data
      - Wilcoxon / Mann-Whitney for not normal data.
    - Use paired tests when you are measuring/comparing a treatment of a test.
      - e.g., gcc -O2 versus gcc -O3
      - Wilcoxon signed rank test
      - The tests can estimate confidence intervals as well
    - When comparing rates/ratios consider if you can match the results as a poisson.
      - Consider the Exact Poisson tests with Matching Confidence Intervals
        - https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/exactci/versions/1.3-3/topics/poisson.exact
      - Or Comparison of Poisson rates
    - When doing factor analysis consider:
      - Kruskall Wallace to determine if the factors matter
        - then pairwise (not paired) Wilcoxons or pairwise confidence intervals
*** If it is PASS/FAIL
    - use statistics for Beurnolli Trials
    - Like Two Proportions test.
    - Or if it is multicategorical X^2.
